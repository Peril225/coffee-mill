		<h3>Our History</h3>
		<p class="subtitle">
		WHEN COFFEE MILL WAS FOUNDED IN 1974 WE OFFERED 2 REGULAR COFFEE BLENDS AND ONE DECAF. TODAY, COFFEE MILL OFFERS MORE THAN 30 DIFFERENT COFFEE BLENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
		Though the coffee offerings have changed considerably the commitment to service remains as strong. Coffee Mill doesn’t simply drop<br> supplies on your doorstep, we are a service-oriented organization. With each visit our staff cleans and exchanges your airpots and carafes,<br> test your office coffee machine equipment, and cleans and organizes the beverage area.
		</p>
		<p>At Coffee Mill, our staff takes great pride in their work, and it shows in terms of their longevity. The average tenure among the approx<br> one dozen Coffee Mill drivers is a remarkable 10-plus years. Recently Coffee Mill celebrated one employee’s 37th anniversary <br>with the business! We are a leader in office coffee machines in the Twin Cities MN.
		</p>
		<p>
		Over the past four decades Coffee Mill has built a stellar reputation in the industry, as not necessarily the biggest, but the best. In 2011 the<br> company was honored to become Dunn Bros. exclusive office coffee supplier, a true testament to the company’s focus on outstanding<br> customer service.
